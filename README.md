Tech Stock Scrapes

Program I built to scrape stock data from the internet. Tracks the daily fluctuations between five different Tech Stocks(AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, AMD, MSFT) - price, price change, and percentage change. The data collected is input to a database using sqlite3. Using this data, I hope to spot trends and patterns while we head towards a potential recession.
